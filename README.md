Carsales Dashboard:-
 It is a dashboard related to car sales, possibly containing information like sales data, personnel, or other relevant metrics.
Sales Data: 
   - Starting from row 20, there is structured data with column headers like "Row Labels," "Count of year," and other unnamed columns that seem to represent brand 
      names and corresponding selling prices.
   - The years (e.g., 1994, 1995) are listed along with the number of car sales (`Count of year`) for those specific years.
   - Additional columns seem to relate to brands and the sum of selling prices associated with each brand.
     
Key Insights:

1) Year by Year car sales: The sheet seems to track car sales data across various years, with information on the number of sales per year.               

2) Brand vs Income: There is also financial data associated with specific car brands, reflecting the total sales amount for each brand.       

3) Km dirven and selling price by each brand: The percentage of kilometeres driven by cars after buying the car from the each brand.            

Purpose:

The purpose of this dashboard appears to be to provide a summary of car sales over a range of years, broken down by brand and sales amount. It might be used for analyzing trends in sales volume and revenue across different car brands over time.
